# Command line arguments

- To take command line inputs, all we do is use the args which is given to `main` method as a `parameter`
- Example
    ```C#
    static void Main(string[] args) // method
        {
            Console.WriteLine(args[0]);
        }

    ```
## Asking user for input
- We use `ReadLine`
- Example
  ```C#
    var x = Console.ReadLine();
    Console.WriteLine("Hello" + x + "we used add signs");
    // or
    Console.WriteLine($"Hello {x} we used curly braces for string interpolation ");

  ```
- C# is statically typed language, and therefore we need to assign data-types to variables before hand. 
  - `var` is used in case where we don't know what the data-type is gonna be. And so it makes things easier for us.
