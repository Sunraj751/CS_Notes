# Basics
- Constructor are just methods, with no return that allow to intantiate
- `Student me = new Student();` here new student() is invoking the constructor 
- After creating custom constructor, default constructor is not created automatically.

## Example
```C#
using System;
namespace Refresh_Csharp
{
    public class Student : User
    {
        public Student(string firstName, string lastName)
        {
            FirstName = firstName;
            LastName = lastName;
            Console.WriteLine("hello");
        }
    }
}
```
