# Basic
- Inheriting from a class. it gives us access to all the functinos in the parent class
- How to inherit?
- 
```C#
using System;
namespace Refresh_Csharp
{
    public class Student : User
    {
    }
}
```
<br/><br/>

# Virtual keyword
- Imagine if we create  a method `Hello()` in Parent class
- And we want to customize `Hello()` method for the class which inherits from parent class. 
- So in order for that to happen, we need to make `Hello()` in parent class a `Virtual Method`
  - So basically allowing child classes to override the method inherited from parent class 
<br/><br/>

# Abstract class
- when something cannot exsist directly
- If someone wants to make a `User` directly, and you add `abstract` keyword, that will prevent someone from making an object using that class
  - And therefore forcing them to make an object of `Student` which `inherits` from User
<br/><br/>

# Code Example
```C#
// Child Class
using System;
namespace Refresh_Csharp
{
    public class Student : User
    {
        public override void Hello()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello running from student " + FullName);
        }
    }
}

// parent class
using System;
namespace Refresh_Csharp
{
    public abstract class User
    {
        public bool Verified { get; set; } = false;
        public string FullName
        {
            get
            {
                return FirstName + " " + LastName;
            }
        }
        
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }

        virtual public void Hello()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hi" + FullName);
        }
    }
}

// Runner 
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace Refresh_Csharp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Program mp = new Program(); 
            mp.doSomething(); 
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        public void doSomething() 
        {
            Student me = new Student();
            me.FirstName = " blah";
            me.LastName = "la";
            me.Hello();
        }
    }
}
```

# Abstract Method
- These methods don't even have a body. 
- Inside of the child class that `inherits` from this abstract class, we will use this abstract function the same way we use override method 
- So basically with an abstract class, you are forcing the the child class to comeup with it's own implementation.

```C#
// in class
public abstract void hello();

// in runner
public override void Hello()
{
    do something 
}
```
