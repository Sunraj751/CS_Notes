# Refresher
- Make sure variable name **doesn't** start with a number

# Value type
- Basically when we user variable 
```C#
    int a = -3;
    int b = a  // value passed to b here is by value

    b = 3; // this will only change value of b not a
```

# Refernce type
- When using array, we have pointer to the first element, and we can pass an array 

```C#
    int a[] = {-5};
    int b[] = a;    // here b points to the array which holds -5
    b[0] = 10;  // this will change the value of a

    // both print same values
    Console.WriteLine(a[0]);
    Console.WriteLine(b[0]);

```
- NaN = > not a number
- IsNaN = > to evaluate if it's a number
- IsInfinity => to check if the number is infinitiy

# math class
```C#
    Math.Round(x); // where x i some number
```
