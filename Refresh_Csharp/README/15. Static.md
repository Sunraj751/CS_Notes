# Basic
- Idea behind static is, it is attached to the whole class rather than just an object. 
  - Like main is a static method
- Also we call static method directly on the class
  
```C#
// in class
public static void PrintUser(User user)
{
    console.WriteLine("Static Method");
}

// in instantiated object
public void DoSomething()
{
    User user = new User();
    User.PrintUser(user); // here we see we called it directly on the class 
}
```
- This is how we printed without a static class (from OOP file)
``` C#
public void doSomething() // this is the method being called
{
    User me = new User();  // instantiation of a new class
    me.FirstName = "sunny";
    me.LastName = "07";
    me.Output(5);
}
```
